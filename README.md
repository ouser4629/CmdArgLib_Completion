## CmdArgLib_Completion

This repositiory provides three executable programs built
using [Command Argument Library](https://github.com/ouser4629/cmd-arg-lib.git). The
repository has a dual purpose.

* Provide examples of how to use the `CommandAction` macro.
* Provide examples of how to generate fish and zsh completion scripts.

The programs `cf-ca1-simple` and `cf-ca2-stateful` use the `CommandAction` macro.
These, along with `cf-print`, generate fish and zsh completion scripts.
